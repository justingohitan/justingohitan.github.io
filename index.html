		<h3> A short poem for my Beloved </h3>
	<body> 	
		<p>A gazillion stars shine in the sky.
		One shines the brightest, I can't deny.
		A love so precious and a love so true,
		a love that comes with me and you.
		The birds keep singing when you are near.
		when in your arms, I have nothing to fear.
		You always know just what to say. 
            'cause talking to you makes me glad all day.</p>
